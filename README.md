Here is my first custom keyboard design.If you make one, please send me a picture or at me on reddit u/leifflat. The keymap is very basic and is for sure missing some things as I intended from the start to use Vial which is the hex I would suggest using, but you can compile it yourself with the provided files.
All the STL files are for one side, and just need to be mirrored for the other side. 

| QTY  | Item |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 6  | 25mm M3 head cap bolts  |
| 18 | 7mm M3 flat head bolts  |
| 12  | M3 heat press inserts (4.5 OD) |
| 12  | M3 nuts  |
| 50 | MX switches  |
| 50 | 1N4148 Diodes  |
| 2 | Pro Micros  |
| 4  | Female USB C breakout boards  |
| 2 | Male Micro USB ends  |
| 2  | Tact switches  |

Tenting legs:
Heat press one nut on one side of all 6 through holes to catch the 25mm bolt.
I dipped the tips in Plastidip to give them a better grip on my desk mat, about 12 coats.

Keyboard:
For the bottom, heat press the bots into the 6 large holes to catch the bolts to connect the tenting body to the keyboard.
Heat press the 12 heat inserts into the body of the keyboard.

Diagram for wiring:
Diodes should be wired in COL2ROW.
See images 1 and 2 in the IMGS folder.
