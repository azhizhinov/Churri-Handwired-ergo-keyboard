Here is my first custom keyboard design.If you make one, please send me a picture or at me on reddit u/leifflat.<br>

The keymap is very basic and is for sure missing some things as I intended from the start to use Vial which is the hex I would suggest using, but you can compile it yourself with the provided files.<br>
All the STL files are for one side, and just need to be mirrored for the other side.<br>
<br>
| QTY  | Item |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 6  | 25mm M3 head cap bolts  |
| 18 | 8mm M3 flat head bolts  |
| 12  | M3 heat press inserts (4.5 OD) |
| 12  | M3 nuts  |
| 50 | MX switches  |
| 50 | 1N4148 Diodes  |
| 2 | Pro Micros  |
| 4  | Female USB C breakout boards  |
| 2 | Male Micro USB ends  |
| 2  | Tact switches  |
<br>
Tenting legs:<br>
Heat press one nut on one side of all 6 through holes to catch the 25mm bolt.<br>
I dipped the tips in Plastidip to give them a better grip on my desk mat, about 12 coats.<br>
<br>
Keyboard:<br>
For the bottom, heat press the bots into the 6 large holes to catch the bolts to connect the tenting body to the keyboard.<br>
Heat press the 12 heat inserts into the body of the keyboard. The breackout boards and Pro Micro can be held down with either doublesided tape or a drop of super glue. You will need to file down 2 of the breakoput boards to fit into place. The tact switch is held in place by super glue. Test the button before glueing as you may need to stretch the hole a bit to make the button easy to press.<br>
<br>
Diagram for wiring:<br>
Diodes should be wired in COL2ROW.<br>
